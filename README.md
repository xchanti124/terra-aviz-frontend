# terra-aviz-frontend

To run:

1. Serve the backend (refer to the README of [terra-aviz-backend](https://github.com/xchanti124/terra-aviz-backend))
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run start`
   - Since the backend server is already running, it should offer you to serve the frontend on port 3001. Say yes to the prompt.
4. For the application to work fully you need to have an `.env` file with the variable `REACT_APP_API_KEY` with a valid Google Maps API key.
